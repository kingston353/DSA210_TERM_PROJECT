## Sleep and Fitness Analysis Project

## Motivation

Nowadays, it is hard for me to maintain a healthy balance between physical activity and rest. This affects my overall well-being and I think I can make changes after making a scientific analysis on this subject.
I chose this project in order to evaluate my sleep habits with my fitness activities including workouts and steps, 
to gain insights into how these factors are afffecting each other. My goal is to optimize my workout programs and overall activity by understanding the relationship between physical activity and sleep patterns. At the end of this project, i will be able to make
more informed decisions which affect my health and productivity thanks to this analysis.

## Main Purposes

- Identify how trends and patterns of my sleep data affects my fitness data
- Explore the relationship between my physical activity (steps, workout sessions, consistency etc.) and my sleep quality (duration, consistency etc.).
- Gain important insights to optimize both my workout routine and sleep schedule for better health and recovery.
- Determine whether the quality of my sleep influences how motivated I am to exercise or make any physical activity.

## Data Sets

- Apple sleep app: Includes detailed information about sleep duration, consistency and trends.
- Apple fitness app: Tracks daily steps, workout sessions, physical activities in a detailed way.
- I will use open source tools and libraries like python, pandas etc. to analyze this data. I think both of these apps include organized and detailed information. Since they are developed by the same company it will be easier for me to use these data sets.

## Techniques and Plan

To achieve the project objectives i will use steps below;
- With Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I will make summary statistics for my sleep and fitness data after I convert these datas to a type that I can compare. I will try to identify correlation and patterns between my activity levels and my sleep duration. I will make trend analysis for different time durations (weeks, months etc.). Then i will continue with the next step which is visualization of this analysis.
- Visualization: I will make categorical analysis for activity types (steps and fitness workouts) and use bar charts and histograms. I will also use correlation heatmaps to explore relationship between activity and sleep. These visualization tools will help me to show trends, outliers and patterns.
- Machine Learning: I will use machine learning tools to optimize my workout and sleep time habits. This step will help me to make correct implementations for my workout and sleep routine.
