Sleep and Fitness Analysis Project

Motivation

Nowadays, it is hard for me to maintain a healthy balance between physical activity and rest. This affects my overall well-being and I thing I can make changes after making a scientific analysis on this subject.
I chose this project in order to evaluate my sleep habits with my fitness activities including workouts and steps, 
to gain insights into how these factors are afffecting each other. My goal is to optimize my workout programs and overall activity by understanding the relationship between physical activity and sleep patterns. At the end of this project, i will be able to make
more informed decisions which affect my health and productivity thanks to this analysis.

Main Purposes

- Identify how trends and patterns of my sleep data affects my fitness data
- Explore the relationship between my physical activity (steps, workout sessions, consistency etc.) and my sleep quality (duration, consistencty etc.).
- Gain important insights to optimize both my workout routine and sleep schedule for better health and recovery.
- Determine whether the quality of my sleep influences how motivated I am to exercise or make any physical activity.

Data sources

- Apple sleep app: Includes detailed information about sleep duration, consistency and trends.
- Apple fitness app: Tracks daily steps, workout sessions, physical activities in a detailed way.
- I will use open source tools and libraries like python, pandas etc. to analyze this data.

Techniques

To achieve the project objectives i will use techniques below;
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I will make summary statistics for my sleep and fitness data. I will try to identify correlation and patterns between my activity levels and my sleep duration. I will make trend analysis for different time durations (weeks, months etc.)
- Visualization: I will make categorical analysis for activity types (steps and fitness workouts) and use bar charts and histograms. I will also use correlation heatmaps to explore relationship between activity and sleep.
- Machine Learning: I might use machine learning to optimize my workout and sleep times and habits.
